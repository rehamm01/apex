Website redesign for Apex Theaters, a company consisting of two movie theaters in Louisville, KY: Baxter Avenue Theatres Filmworks and Village 8 Theaters.

Project consists of a website for Baxter Avenue Theatres Filmworks. The existing content has been streamlined and made responsive for multiple device sizes.

Next Steps: 
I will create a landing page with an option to navigate to either a Baxter Avenue Homepage or a Village 8 Homepage so that the company can have a starting point. I will also create a website for Village 8 Theaters that will follow the design of the Baxter Avenue site.

To complete the Baxter Avenue Homepage, I will create separate information pages for each of the "badges" above the footer. 


Requirements for Code Louisville:
Must use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and/or jQuery. [HTML and CSS used for basic layout and styling. JavaScript and jQuery used for mobile menu dropdown.]

Must be responsive to different device sizes.

Must implement an API. [Google Maps]

Must implement a JavaScript Framework. [AngularJS to load separate HTML files for "Now Showing" and "Coming Soon" sections.]

Must have code on GitHub in a repository no later than Friday, March 25, 2016 at noon


Concerns: Any advice on how best to optimize this site for quicker loading times would be appreciated.
